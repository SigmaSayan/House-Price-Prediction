# House-Price-Prediction
Machine Learning Model for Predicting House Prices
Objective:
Developed a predictive model to estimate house prices in various regions of the USA using a Linear Regression approach. This project aimed to assist real estate agents in accurately predicting house prices based on specific regional parameters.

Description:

Dataset: Utilized a dataset containing 5000 rows and 7 columns. The dataset included information on average area income, house age, number of rooms, number of bedrooms, area population, house price, and address.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted thorough EDA to understand the dataset's structure, identify patterns, and detect any anomalies or outliers. Visualized relationships between different features and the target variable (house price).
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the data for modeling by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing numerical features as needed.
Model Development: Implemented a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on features such as average area income, house age, number of rooms, number of bedrooms, and area population.
Model Evaluation: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) score.
Predictions: Generated predictions on the test set and analyzed the model's accuracy and reliability in estimating house prices.
Technologies and Libraries Used:

Data Manipulation and Analysis: pandas, numpy
Data Visualization: seaborn, matplotlib
Modeling and Evaluation: scikit-learn
Outcome:
Successfully developed a Linear Regression model that provided accurate and reliable estimates of house prices based on various regional parameters. This model can be utilized by real estate agents to make informed decisions and better serve their clients.
